# Prerequisites
- Java 9 or above (Project uses Map.of which is a feature of Java 9.0)
- IntelliJ (optional)

# Features
- No duplicates can be picked
- Pick randomly from 4 suits (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades), card range from 2 - 11 (inclusive).
- Remembers yours and dealers pick and have an option to show all at the end of the program.
- You can replay/restart this game at the end.

# Assumptions
- Assuming that ACE value is 11 all the time, as such there can be total of 4 ACEs to be picked at random. So there's a tiny bit of chance to get 22 or 2 ACE pick at start.
- Range is 2-11 so there are total of 44 cards to be picked at random and previously picked one can not be picked again.
