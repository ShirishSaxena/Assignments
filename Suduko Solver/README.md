# Description and Updates
- Improved and formatted methods.
- Randomize for now only generate random sudoku diagonally, it doesn't always generate valid sudokus but works for testing optimization in batch.
   Will redo the randomize function asap.

- Added menu which includes 4 option (hardcoded sol, manual input, random batch solve, exit)
